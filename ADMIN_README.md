## File Structure

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── admin/
│   │   ├── ProjectsManager.jsx    # Projects CRUD component
│   │   └── NewsManager.jsx        # News CRUD component
│   └── ProtectedRoute.jsx         # Route protection component
├── context/
│   └── AuthContext.jsx            # Authentication context
├── pages/
│   ├── AdminDashboard.jsx         # Main dashboard page
│   └── LoginPage.jsx              # Login page
├── services/
│   └── dataService.js             # Data persistence service
└── App.jsx                        # Main app with routing
```

## Customization

### Adding New Content Types

1. Create a new manager component in `src/components/admin/`
2. Add the content type to the data service
3. Update the dashboard navigation
4. Add the route to the main app

### Styling

- The dashboard uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Custom CSS classes are in `src/index.css`
- Responsive breakpoints follow Tailwind's mobile-first approach

### Data Storage

- Currently uses localStorage for demo purposes
- Easy to replace with API calls by updating the data service
- All data operations are centralized in `dataService.js`

## Security Considerations

### Demo Environment

- Uses simple username/password authentication
- Credentials are hardcoded for demo purposes
- No server-side validation

### Production Deployment

- Implement proper server-side authentication
- Use secure session management
- Add input validation and sanitization
- Implement proper error handling
- Use HTTPS for all communications

## Browser Support

- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
- Requires JavaScript enabled

## Performance

- Lazy loading for dashboard components
- Optimized image handling
- Efficient state management
- Minimal bundle size

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Login not working**: Ensure you're using the correct credentials (admin/admin123)
2. **Images not uploading**: Check browser file permissions
3. **Data not persisting**: Ensure localStorage is enabled in your browser
4. **Mobile layout issues**: Clear browser cache and refresh
